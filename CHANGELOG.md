# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), starting at `0.1.0`.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **DB-backed application settings** — SMTP, ntfy push, Ollama, barcode
  lookup, S3/SFTP backup destinations, and cron schedules are now
  configurable from Settings > System in the admin UI, with no Docker
  restart required. Sensitive values (passwords, tokens, keys) are
  encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM when `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set.
  Environment variables remain as fallbacks for zero-migration upgrades.
- **Rental tracking** on Home properties — record rental agreements with
  weekly rent, tenant name, lease dates, and bond amount, then import
  monthly property-manager statements via file upload with AI-assisted
  extraction and automatic reconciliation against expected rent. Supports
  REIWA Form 1AA lease extraction.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **Opt-in module system** — admins choose which modules to enable at
  first-run setup and can toggle them on/off later from Settings > Modules.
  Nav items and all routes for disabled modules are hidden and redirect to
  the dashboard.
- **Travel module** — TripIt-style itinerary tracker with Flight, Lodging,
  and Activity segment types. Supports AI-assisted field extraction from
  uploaded confirmation documents (mirroring the existing Contract flow),
  manual entry, and per-segment document storage with authenticated download.
- **Home module** — property and maintenance/improvement/repair tracker.
  Track multiple properties with address, notes, and a full item history
  including provider, date, cost, and supporting documents. AI-assisted
  field extraction from uploaded invoices is supported.
- **Tax-deductible tracking** on home items — mark individual items as tax
  deductible and see a summary of tax-deductible spend broken down by AU
  financial year (1 Jul–30 Jun) on the Home list page.
- **Playwright e2e test suite** (28 tests) covering regression, module-toggle
  gating, Travel CRUD, upload security, and authorisation, running
  automatically on every push and pull request via GitHub Actions.

### Fixed

- Document upload body-size limits now consistently allow up to 15 MB across
  both Server Actions and API routes (previously the Server Action limit was
  1 MB, causing uploads over that size to hard-crash rather than show a
  friendly validation error).
- Heuristic field extraction: `findCost` no longer over-matches on the word
  "fee"; `findCompanyLine` skips lines containing dollar amounts or GST/total
  keywords so tax-summary lines are not mistaken for a company name.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- Contract and product/warranty tracking with CRUD, list views, and expiry
  badges.
- Reminder notifications via email (SMTP) and push (ntfy) on configurable
  per-item thresholds, plus signed webhook delivery for integrations like
  Home Assistant or an MCP agent.
- Dashboard overview of upcoming expirations.
- Multi-user households with an admin setup flow and Auth.js-based
  authentication.
- Bring-your-own-key AI field extraction (Anthropic, Gemini, or OpenAI) to
  auto-fill contract/product details from an uploaded document; keys are
  encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM).
- Barcode scanning for product entry.
- Read-only MCP server for querying contracts and products from an LLM.
- Encrypted offsite database backups to S3 and/or SFTP.
- Native iOS wrapper app (Capacitor) with mTLS client-certificate support.
- Self-hosting via Docker / docker-compose, with an nginx + mTLS
  access-lockdown guide.
